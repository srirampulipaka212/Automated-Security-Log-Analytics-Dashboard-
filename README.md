Automated Security Log Analytics Dashboard
Project Overview
This project automates the collection, cleaning, analysis, and visualization of security logs from servers, networks, and firewalls. By building custom Python ETL pipelines and integrating with dashboarding tools, the system enables real-time monitoring, anomaly detection, and automated alerting—streamlining security operations and incident response.

Features
Automated Log Ingestion: Collects logs from multiple sources (servers, network devices, firewalls).

Data Cleaning & Enrichment: Uses Python scripts to parse, normalize, and enrich raw log data for analysis.

Anomaly Detection: Applies statistical methods to identify unusual activity, reducing false positives and highlighting genuine threats.

Real-Time Dashboards: Presents actionable insights via Splunk, Grafana, or similar visualization tools.

Automated Alerting: Triggers notifications for critical security events, speeding up incident response.

Comprehensive Documentation: Includes setup guides, code comments, and runbooks for easy onboarding and reproducibility.

Technologies Used
Python (pandas, numpy, re, datetime, os)

Log Collection Tools (Syslog, Filebeat, or cloud logging services)

Dashboarding (Splunk, Grafana, Tableau)

Alerting (Email, Slack, or webhook integrations)

Scheduling (Cron, Apache Airflow)

Version Control (Git/GitHub)

Sample Workflow
Logs are collected from servers, network devices, and firewalls.

Python scripts process the logs: parsing, cleaning, and enriching the data.

Anomaly detection logic flags suspicious patterns or activities.

Processed data is fed into a dashboarding tool (Splunk, Grafana, etc.) for visualization.

Alerts are configured to notify teams of critical events.

Documentation ensures the pipeline is reproducible and maintainable.
