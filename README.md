By building custom Python ETL pipelines, the system enables real-time monitoring, anomaly detection, and automated alertingâ€”streamlining security operations and incident response.

## Features

- **Automated log ingestion** from multiple sources.
- **Data cleaning and enrichment** using Python scripts.
- **Anomaly detection** to highlight suspicious activity.
- **Structured output** for easy import into Splunk, Grafana, Tableau, or similar tools.

## Technologies Used

- **Python** (pandas, numpy, re, datetime, os)
- **Splunk, Grafana, or Tableau** (for visualization)
- **Git/GitHub** for version control
